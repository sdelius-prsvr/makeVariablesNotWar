# Make Variables Not War

Now you'll be making many many variables. You will be so very able! (Sorry about that.)

### Setup

Welcome to your first test-based assignment! You're gonna love it once you get the hang of it.

You'll:

- Create and clone a new repo.
- Copy project contents into your new local repo.
- Navigate into the directory.
- Run `jest --watch-all`.
- Write your code in the section below "YOUR CODE BELOW" in `main.js`.
- Watch as your tests turn green.
- Add a link to your repo as your assignment submission when you're done!

### Guidelines

- If another variable is mentioned in a task's description, that variable needs to appear in your code for that task to be marked correct. In other words, if `x` is `5` and you're asked to set `y` in terms of `x` so that it's twice `x`, the following code is correct:

```javascript
y = x * 2;
```

While the following code is not:

```javascript
y = 10;
```

This is because in the first example, if `x` changed value, `y` would continue to be twice `x`, but in the second example, `y` would always be `10`.

### Tasks

- Create a variable called `myFirstName`. Assign `myFirstName` a string value that represents your first name.
- Create a variable called `myLastName`. Assign `myLastName` a string value that represents your last name.
- Create a variable called `myBestFriend`. Assign `myBestFriend` a string value that represents your best friend name.
- Create a variable called `mySentence`. Assign `mySentence` a string that includes the variables from the previous three tasks.
- Create another variable called `myFavoriteNum`. Assign `myFavoriteNum` a number value that represents your favorite number!
- Create another variable called `myMentalAge`. Assign `myMentalAge` a number value that represents your mental age!
- Create another variable called `myHeight`. Assign `myHeight` a number value that represents your height in inches or centimeters!
- Create another variable called `myFavoriteYear`. Assign `myFavoriteYear` a number value that represents your favorite year!

### Tasks that use MATH

- Create another variable called `mySum`. Set it equal to the result of three plus one thousand nine hundred eighteen plus twenty-four plus one. Calculate it in code!
- Create another variable called `myProduct`. Set it equal to the result of two hundred thirty-two times forty-three divided by two plus four (the operations should be written in that order!). Calculate it in code!
- Create another variable called `myHeightAndAge`. Set it equal to the sum of your mental age and height. Calculate it in code!
